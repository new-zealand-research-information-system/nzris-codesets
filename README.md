# New Zealand Research Information System (NZRIS) Codesets

* Version: 0.6
* Generated: 16 June 2022

This repository aims to collate all codesets used by NZRIS into a machine
readable format. NZRIS will be a national, online hub of information about the
Research Science and Innovation (RSI) sector. You can find out more about the
NZRIS project on [MBIE's website at
www.mbie.govt.nz/nzris](https://www.mbie.govt.nz/nzris) (active at 17 December
2021).
 
NZRIS uses a number of national and international standards, as well as codesets
used by the RSI sector, and those specifically developed for NZRIS in
consultation with the RSI sector.

This repository contains codesets in Excel (xlsx), Comma Separated Values (CSV)
format, Tab Separated Values (TSV) format, and JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)
and Excel (xlsx) format. If you intend to use the codesets with Excel, we
recommend that you use the Excel (xlsx) files, as some other formats such as CSV
are altered on opening.

Note that the **public sector financial resource codeset** is intended to aid in
filling out the "Public Sector Financial Resource" sub-entity. In this
codeset we have aimed to cover as many RSI appropriations as possible, however
there may be additional values that need to be added to this list. You can
notify us of the need to add additional appropriations through [raising an issue
on this
repository](https://github.com/new-zealand-research-information-system/nzris-codesets/issues).
Note also that the amounts listed are the maximum for the estimates of 
appropriations.

All codesets have `Version`, `Code`, and `Description` columns. Note that
either the `Code` or `Description` for a codeset can be used when submitting
information to NZRIS.

Note that where a codeset has multiple levels we have used the most detailed for
the "Code" and "Description" fields, and made the others available as additional
columns using upper snake case names such as `Two_Digit_Code` and
`Two_Digit_Description` for the Australian and New Zealand Standard Research
Classification (ANZSRC) Socio-Economic Objective codeset. Not all levels of each
codeset can be submitted to NZRIS. For more detail on which levels can be
submitted, see the [NZRIS Data
Specifications](https://www.mbie.govt.nz/dmsdocument/1275-nzris-data-specification-2-01)
(active at 17 December 2021). As at version 2.01 of the NZRIS Data Specifications,
ethnicity is the only field that can be submitted in either of two levels of the
same codeset; level two, or level four can be submitted.


### Some adjustments and assumptions have been made to fit the codesets into a standard model

* **ANZSRC Type of Activity (ToA) 2008 and 2020**: codes have been assigned (1-4) 
to each type of activity to align this structure with other codesets, however 
these are not part of the formal definition. 
* **International Standards Organisation (ISO) 639 Language Codes**: the three
letter code (ISO-639-2/T) has been used, as it provides good language coverage,
and the "a" in MƒÅori has been macronised.
* **International Standards Organisation (ISO) 4217 Currency Codes**: the three
letter code has been used as the code rather than the numeric code due to wide
adoption, the numeric code is provided for reference only.
* **Public Sector Financial Resource**: multi-category appropriations are listed
with their categories in the format "Appropriation: Category", to maintain a 
link between the Appropriation ID, and to better track appropriations over time.
The code has been created as a composite of identifier, year and type.
* **ANZSRC Socio-economic objective (ANZSRC SEO) 2020**: there are two codes
with the description "Insects", the four-digit description has been added in 
order to distinguish between these when data is attempted to be matched back
to a code.
* **ORCID Work Types**: a version has been added as the date published on the 
[ORCID fequently asked questions page](https://info.orcid.org/faq/what-work-types-does-orcid-support/).


### Characters in the codesets may display differently depending on the program used to open them

These codesets have been created using [UTF-8 Encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) 
as this is seen by many as best practice for balancing character coverage and
space taken to store characters. Some systems have native support for UTF-8,
however many commonly used programs such as Microsoft Excel many not have the
ability to detect these characters and will convert them to another encoding.
See ["How to import CSV file that uses UTF-8 encoding"](https://excel.officetuts.net/en/examples/how-to-import-csv-file-that-uses-utf-8-encoding)
for a description of how to import files with UTF-8 encoding into Excel.


### Some codeset names may differ from their reference in the data specifications

In order to retain accurate descriptions of codesets, codeset names have been
recorded as they are found at source, and abbreviations have been expanded. This
means that there are some differences between the names of the codesets in the
NZRIS Data Specifications and the names used in this repository. Here is a
current summary of the differences between version 2.01 of the Data
Specifications and names used in this repository:
